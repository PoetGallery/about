### Brief Description
> `PoetGallery is the first decentralized NFT Bookstore for Poetry Collections.  

Inspired by “Le Cadavre Exquisite” - it’s a creative experiment where each participant contributes to a collective poem, writing 3 lines of poetry, and reading only the last one before theirs, till the completion of the poem.

Artists and Poets co-create a shared Poetry Collection, of which they have full ownership, and whose royalties are shared amongst all the contributors.`

# How we built it
- _IPFS NFT Storage_: for practical reasons of decentralization, usability, and permanence of Data.
- _Contracts deployed on Polygon_: ecosystem, reliability, and infinite potential to build and customize a multi-NFT Marketplace for Art Collectives.
- _Covalent + TheGraph_: to visualize rich data for Poetry Collections & Participants
- _NFT Poetry Books deployed on OpenSea_: still the most straightforward, and Artist-/Developer-friendly Marketplace

### Longer Description - how it works
Artists and Poets co-create a shared Poetry Collection, of which they have full ownership, and whose royalties are shared amongst all the contributors.

Inspired by “Le Cadavre Exquisite” - it’s a creative experiment where each participant contributes to a collective poem, writing 3 lines of poetry, and reading only the last one before theirs, till the completion of the poem.

#### Artists
Can create Artworks & Covers for surrealist Poetry Collections

1. You choose an Archetype and a line of poetry that represents your Artwork
2. You upload Artwork + brief description
3. Poets can select your Artwork as the cover of the Poetry Collection
4. Every time your Artwork is selected and the Collection is sold, you get royalties. Forever.

#### Poets
can create collective Poems & Poetry collections based on a theme.

1. Join an Open Room, or create your own.
2. You choose Archetype & cover.
3. Each participant writes 3 lines.
4. Once the Room is closed, the poem added to a unique collection.
5. You and the other poets receive an equal amount of profit for each Collection Sale. Forever.

#### Rooms
Rooms are where Poets compose the individual, collective poems part of a Collection.
Rooms can be of 2 types: for 3 or 5 Participants (Poets).
Each Poet adds 3 lines, so: 
- Rooms with 3 Participants will always generate 9-line poems
- Rooms with 5 Participants will always generate 15-line poems

#### Collections
Each Collection is composed by the individual Poems created in the Rooms.
Each Collection will have in total 135 lines:
- 3-poet collections will have 15 poems / collection
- 5-poet collections will have 9 poems / collection

Tokenomics & Distribution:
- 3-poet collections will always have 60 participants (45 poets + 15 artists)
- 5-poet collections will have 54 participants (45 poets + 9 artists)
- We do a linear distribution, so if the same person/address repeats, it just gets paid 2, 3, ..., times.
- Breakdown is as follows:
-   20% for Room Creators & 20% for Artists: 
-    3-room collections: 
-     2.22% per Room Creator, 1.33% per Artist
-    5-room collections: 
-     1.33% per Room Creator, 2.22% per Artist
-   40% for other Poets participating:
-     3-room collections: 1.33% per Poet (30 participants)
-     5-room collections: 1.11% per Poet (36 participants)
-   10% for Dev Team
-   10% for DAO Treasury & Protocol Development
